ToDo:
	Give Asset some kind of error checking.
	
	Integrate a version of HD testing.
		Save and new number focus and select ID field.
		Should have checkbox and then have these enabled. I think this will be duplicated in Ultimate Transfer. 
			Should have in title
			Should have specific type
			Should have specific tests/condition
			Should have specific specs
	Create Options Window.
		Integrate Shipping JS. 
	
	Purchase Google Developer access. 	
	Create Ultimate transfer. 
	Integrate boxing.
	Add by SN to Return.
	
Things this fixes:
	Clicks single PO
	Better return page
		More normal transfer boxes
		Clicking on the X removes item and reloads return order
		Unsets condition after return.
		
Things this modifies:
	showLoading
	hideLoading
	addOrderLine
		Clears results
		Clicks print
		Sets focus to External Asset
	saveAsset
		Locks the condition
		Sets focus to product line
	loadReturnDetail
		Reorganizes the Returns page
	loadDetail 
		If in Return, runs the loadReturnDetail instead. 
	selectAsset
		Does not override, but I do use my own version to load assets. It removes the breadcrum notification. 

Things this overloads:
	newWindow (For shortreports and for printing asset tags)
	
Things that are broken in this addon:

Things that are broken in IMS:
	Adding product to a return. 
	Adding product to a SO.
	Saving a return does nothing.
	Returns don't update the Managed Transfer list.
