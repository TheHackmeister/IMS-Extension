ToDo:
	High Priority
		Rename Build + HD-Page. 
		Move PO Specific commands in General to their own file. 
		Remove Improved Page set.
			Add alerts to the check, or remove check too.
		Fix a listener in AssetCheck.
		
	Medium Priority
		Improved Location Page. (Basically boxing)
		Give Asset(Or Form?) some kind of error checking.
		Integrate a version of HD testing.
			Save and new number focus and select ID field.
			Should have checkbox and then have these enabled. I think this will be duplicated in Ultimate Transfer. 
		Better eroor messages. Include what was expected and what was found.
		
	Low Priority
		Make returns not change page. Add response to page, and remove in the same way so does.
		If number is product, just do that product.
			
	Back burner
		Create Ultimate transfer. 	
		Hard Drive page - Pass all and save.
		Boxing page
		Check on location transfer. No asset should have more than 4 digits. 	
		Add by SN to Return. 
		Edit asset search by SN. Would have to split load into loadFromID and loadFromSN and pick the one at load. Also, loadFromSN first has to look up SN, then load that Asset.
			Maybe I can have a precommand that says getSN. I get the SN, then I load it.
		Consider making a laptop guesser. Could use AI
		Have ability to turn off features.
	
Features
	Miscellaneous Usability
		For POs, SOs, Returns, and Edit Assets, 
			If there was only one result for the search, it is selected automatically. 
			Allows submitting information with the enter key rather than clicking the button 
			When enter is pressed (or an item is scanned) in the location field, focus is moved to the list field. (Not applicable for Edit Assets).
		Deleting an asset from a SO is reflected immediately. 
		Gives visual feedback for when page is loading
		Short report includes a count by item description. 
		Printing automatically pops up the print window, includes a way for the AutoHotKey program to tie in, and closes after printing.
		Has option to immediately add scanned assets to a SO. 

	POs
		Allows better flow for adding product to a PO
			Selecting a product moves focus to SN. 
			Pressing enter (Or scanning) while in the SN field moves the focus to the Location field.
			When adding lines to a PO
				Prints tag
				Selects asset
				Focus external asset number.
			Save automatically locks the condition and focuses the product field. 	
		Checks EAN both for correctness and existence. 
			
	Returns
		More normal transfer boxes
		Clicking on the X removes item and reloads return order
		Unsets condition after return. (Option to turn off)
		Because you can't add a product to a return, I removed the add product to return field.
				
	Improved Edit Asset Page
		Lets you inspect and change assets without having to do the 4 clicks needed in the Edit Asset section.
			
	Behind The Scenes 
		Auto Update
		Alerts me when Brad changes function calls.
		Has specific calls for the AutoHotKey program(barcodes) to tie into. 
		Removed the backspace as a shortcut for the back button. It stops AutoHotKey from changing pages.
