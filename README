ToDo:
	Add product to Return - Can't. No command :( Remove div?
	Investigate how product added to a SO/Return is counted in inventory. (SO it isn't effected. Maybe it has to be marked as shipped?)
	Make return events have a permanent listener.
	Have auto select PO work for returns and SO too.
	
	Give Asset some kind of error checking.
	Integrate a version of HD testing.
		Save and new number focus and select ID field.
		Should have checkbox and then have these enabled. I think this will be duplicated in Ultimate Transfer. 
			Should have in title
			Should have specific type
			Should have specific tests/condition
			Should have specific specs
 
	Figure out how to do MD5 hash or something on function and compare to my functions. Then it can alert me when Brad changes important things.	
	Create Ultimate transfer. 
	Integrate boxing.
	Add by SN to Return.
	
Things this fixes:
	Automatically selects PO
	Better return page
		More normal transfer boxes
		Clicking on the X removes item and reloads return order
		Unsets condition after return.
	Gives visual feedback for when page is loading.
	Allows adding of product to sales order.
		
Things this modifies:
	showLoading
	hideLoading
	addOrderLine
		Clears results
		Clicks print
		Sets focus to External Asset
	saveAsset
		Locks the condition
		Sets focus to product line
	loadReturnDetail
		Reorganizes the Returns page
	loadSalesOrderDetail
		Reorganizes the SO page
	addSalesOrderLineProduct
		Had to do some juggling of IDs. It happens here. 
	loadDetail 
		If in Return, runs the loadReturnDetail instead. 
		If in SO, it runs the viewSODetailList command instead. It is set to do it as a container. Can change.
	selectAsset
		Does not override, but I do use my own version to load assets. It removes the breadcrum notification. 

		
Things this overloads:
	newWindow (For shortreports and for printing asset tags)
	
Things that are broken in this addon:

Things that are broken in IMS:
	Adding product to a return. 
	Adding product to a SO. I have implemented a fix.
	Saving a return does nothing.
	
	Returns don't update the Managed Transfer list.
