ToDo:
	High Priority

	
	Medium Priority
		Give Asset(Or Form?) some kind of error checking.
		Integrate a version of HD testing.
			Save and new number focus and select ID field.
			Should have checkbox and then have these enabled. I think this will be duplicated in Ultimate Transfer. 
		Make returns not change page. Add response to page, and remove in the same way so does.
		
	Low Priority
		Add event listener to location in PO. Also do so on selecting 0f product. 
		If number is product, just do that product.
			
	Back burner
		Create Ultimate transfer. 	
		Hard Drive page - Pass all and save.
		Boxing page
		Check on location transfer. No asset should have more than 4 digits. 	
		Add by SN to Return. 
	
Things this fixes:
	Automatically selects PO
	Deleting an asset from a SO
	*Better return page
		More normal transfer boxes
		Clicking on the X removes item and reloads return order
		Unsets condition after return.
		*Because you can't add a product to a return, I removed the add product to return field.
		*Add Product to Return
		*Enter on return location should move to asset tags.
	Gives visual feedback for when page is loading.
	-Allows adding of product to sales order.
	Allows submitting information with the enter key rather than clicking the button. 
	Allows better flow for adding product to a PO
		Automatically prints tag and loads new asset when adding to PO
		Save automatically locks the condition and focuses the product field. 
	Alerts me when Brad changes function calls.
	
Things this modifies:
	showLoading
	hideLoading
	*addOrderLine
		*Clears results
		*Clicks print
		*Sets focus to External Asset
	saveAsset
		Locks the condition
		Sets focus to product line
	loadReturnDetail
		Reorganizes the Returns page
	deleteSalesOrderline 
		Brads code requires the calling element, but does not include it on the page. This finds that element and includes it in the call. 
//	loadSalesOrderDetail
//		Reorganizes the SO page
//	*addSalesOrderLineProduct
//		*Had to do some juggling of IDs. It happens here. 
	loadDetail 
		If in Return, runs the loadReturnDetail instead. 
		-If in SO, it runs the viewSODetailList command instead. It is set to do it as a container. Can change.
	*selectAsset
		*Does not override, but I do use my own version to load assets. It removes the breadcrumb notification. 

		
Things this overloads:
	newWindow (For short reports and for printing asset tags)
	
Things that are broken in this addon:
	*Returns
	
Things that are broken in IMS:
	Adding product to a SO. I have implemented a fix.
	Adding product to a return. Needs back-end implementation. 
	Saving a return does nothing. - Back-end.
	Returns don't update the Managed Transfer list.  Back-end.
	

	
	
	
	
Short report gives number of each product type
